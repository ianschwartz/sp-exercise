# Visualizing Wheel Data

This is built in Vanilla JavaScript. To run, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Initiate the http server of your choice.

I use Python SimpleHTTPServer which ships with all Apple and Linux computers. Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and then point your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

### Tests

Testing is done with Jest. To run the test sweet use the command `yarn jest`

Thanks!
